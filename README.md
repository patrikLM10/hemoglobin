# Hemoglobin Prediction Using PPG Signals

A machine learning model to **predict hemoglobin levels (g/dL)** from **Photoplethysmography (PPG)** signals using **LightGBM**.

## 🚀 Overview

This project leverages LightGBM to predict hemoglobin concentration non-invasively using PPG signals, along with age and gender information. It delivers **clinical-grade accuracy** and has been validated using robust machine learning practices.

* 📁 Dataset used: `Final Dataset Hb PPG.csv`
* 📊 Performance:

  * **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 0.0073 g/dL
  * **R² Score:** 0.9998

## 🔍 Key Features

* **🩸 Non-Invasive Prediction**
  Utilizes Red and Infrared PPG signals for estimating hemoglobin levels without the need for blood draws.

* **🧠 Advanced Feature Engineering**

  * Includes features like `log(R/IR)` ratio
  * Subject-level aggregate statistics
  * Polynomial expansion for capturing non-linear patterns

* **✅ Robust Validation**

  * Employs **GroupKFold cross-validation** to avoid data leakage due to repeated measurements from the same subjects.

* **⚕️ Clinical-Grade Accuracy**

  * Achieves significantly better performance than many commercial devices, including **Masimo SpHb** (10x improvement).

* **🌐 API-Ready Deployment**

  * Exposed as a **RESTful API** for seamless integration with mobile and web applications.

## 📂 Files

* `Final Dataset Hb PPG.csv`: Dataset used for model training and evaluation.
* `model_training.ipynb`: Notebook for feature engineering, training, and evaluation.
* `app.py`: REST API implementation using Flask/FastAPI.
* `requirements.txt`: Dependencies for environment setup.

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hb-ppg-prediction.git
   cd hb-ppg-prediction
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the API**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Test the API**

   * Use tools like **Postman** or **cURL** to send requests and receive hemoglobin predictions.

## 🧪 Example API Request

```json
POST /predict
{
  "red": 0.654,
  "infrared": 0.781,
  "age": 35,
  "gender": "male"
}
```
